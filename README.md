# Khaba Frontend

The frontend for a 3rd place winning hackathon project built with React. Implements maps using Leaflet.

The problem domain was to solve food insecurity so we focused solving food waste and food redistribution.

This app tracks wasted food and then plans a route to collect all the wasted food and redistribute them.

How to run:
1. Clone
2. run `npm i` in the terminal inside the repo
3. run `npm start` in the terminal inside the repo
